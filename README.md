## Installation
This project uses the KITTI dataset, specifically the 3D object detection Velodyne point clouds, training labels of object data, and camera calibration matrices of objects.

To install these datasets, navigate to the [KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/). You must register for an account if you have not already.

Once you have created an account, navigatte to [Object -> 3d object](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d) in the navigation bar. From here, download the following three datasets:
- Velodyne point clouds, if you want to use laser information (29GB)
- Camera calibration matrics of object data set (16MB)
- Training labels of object data set (5MB)
